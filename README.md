TopStackElasticCache
====================

This is the Elastic Cache API implementation for TopStack.  Caching frequently-used data is an important part of a modern
scalable application.  This API provides the ability to create caches programmatically or from scripts, using the
API developed by Amazon Web Services, on different public or private clouds.

This service is part of the TopStack suite of services.  You can find our more about TopStack on the main project page, 
http://topstack.org/
